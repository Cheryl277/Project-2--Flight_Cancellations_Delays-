### Project Description/Outline: 
Our project's goal is to clean the massive datas to deliver a direct database on the delays/cancellation of the flights. We will focus on cleaning the datas, and bringing the datas together to make a clear database. Our objective is to summarize the percentage of delays/cancellation per airport in order to find the most active reason of occurance for cancellation/dalays.

### Datas we used:

### Tasks:
Our team initially had difficulties loading the datas to MongoDB, Postgres due the large size of the datas. We found using pandas the easiest way to load/clean our datas. By selecting/erasing the useless datas, we can choose what type of information we want.  We used groupby, to merge the datas together to create the final database.
