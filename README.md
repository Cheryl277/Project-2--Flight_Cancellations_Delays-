### Project Description/Outline: 
Our project's goal is to clean the massive datas to deliver a direct database on the delays/cancellation of the flights. We will focus on cleaning the datas, and bringing the datas together to make a clear database. Our objective is to summarize the percentage of delays/cancellation per airport in order to find the most active occurance for cancellation/dalays.
